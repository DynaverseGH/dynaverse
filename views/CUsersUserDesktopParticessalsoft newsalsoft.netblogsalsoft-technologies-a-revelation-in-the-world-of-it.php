                  <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">How Dynaverse is contributing to the progress of IT exports in Pakistan.</h2>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Pakistan has been prevailingly dominating the IT industry game for the past couple of years, and companies like Dynaverse Technologies, led by visionaries like Mr. Salman Ghaznavi, are leading the charge while enabling exceptional outcomes. With the CEO's stringent belief on the fact that “effective leadership is not about making speeches or being liked; leadership is defined by results, not attributes,”; Dynaverse Technologies has been a game-changer in the IT industry.”</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">As per Payoneer's Global Gig Economy Index, which was published in Forbes Magazine, Pakistan was among the top freelance markets of the world, surpassing India, Bangladesh, and Russia with a record 47% growth. With so much growth in the IT sector, one of the companies that have been significantly contributing to the growth of Pakistan and its IT exports is Dynaverse Technologies.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4"><a href="../../index.html">Dynaverse Technologies</a> was established over 20 years ago under the superlative visualization of Salman Ghaznavi, the CEO and founder of Dynaverse. The leap was taken in a time-scape when the IT industry was in just the initial stages of its embryotic transcendence. What started off as a small software house is now one of the biggest IT companies in Pakistan that provides software-related solutions like web development, mobile application development for start-ups and enterprises bit adds AI, mobile development, and AR/VR solutions to its never-ending portfolio.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Dynaverse Technologies is geared with skillful and talented orthodox and out-of-the-bound unorthodox teams for digital marketing, programming, graphics designing and animations, and branding teams, who have provided services & solutions to various start-ups, companies, and enterprises. Dynaverse Technologies has made staff augmentation for start-ups, small and medium-sized enterprises, corporations, and high-end agencies extremely facile and is currently one of the biggest IT exporters of Pakistan.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">The company has operations in suitable national and international locations currently, with some of them being the United States, UAE, and England, and Dubai, which is a huge achievement for a software house that started off its operations merely two decades ago and has now evolved into a giant tech conglomerate dominating the IT game under a pristine leadership.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Dynaverse Technologies currently has over 1000 employees under its payroll and has been able to hire over 600 people in the last six months despite the pandemic when many companies suffered losses and were opting towards downsizing their workforce. Dynaverse Technologies was one of the few Pakistani companies that managed to increase the headcount of its workforce and took it as an opportunity to hire the best employees.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">The company is confident that there are many potentials still yet to be explored in the IT industry, which can only be achieved once an IT company can set an environment for its employees. An environment where they are encouraged to grow in terms of their salaries and personal and professional growth.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">In the current era of technological advancements, when most of the innovations come from the Silicon Valley and other developed regions of the world, Dynaverse Technologies is taking the Pakistani IT industry to new heights by working and collaborating with multiple national and international projects and ventures while equipping its workforce with the relevant training required to enhance their skills. The open culture of creativity and internal collaboration amongst the employees has helped them expand on their expertise and enabled Dynaverse Technologies to become the tech giant that it is today.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Dynaverse was merely a small software house about two decades ago and has expanded towards complete hardware solutions and system integration. The pace at which the company has grown in the past few years leaves a legacy for other IT companies that is unmatched in terms of all aspects and will continue to do so in the future.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Amidst the COVID-Pandemic, Dynaverse Technologies was one of the few companies that continued its full-fledged hiring process in Karachi, Lahore, and its foreign divisions.</p>
                  <p class="primary text regular mb-4">One thing is clear, Dynaverse Technologies is emphasizing the need to create a workspace where the employees envision themselves growing with the organization. With Salman Ghaznavi at the forefront of the operations and his infused vision to help the company break the fourth wall, Dynaverse is taking things further in the world of IT.</p>
