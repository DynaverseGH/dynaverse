                    <!-- <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">How Dynaverse is contributing to the progress of IT exports in Pakistan.</h2> -->
                    
                    <!-- <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">What is Augmented Reality? </h2> -->

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Let's begin the NFT journey with a sweet short story: "Watching your favorite ice cream flavor buckets inside the ice cream parlor is the art of a confectioner/pastry chef. Let's face it. You cannot deliver such succulent and creamy ice treats. And now let's scoop it: dig a few random ice cream snowballs and fuse them. Now that's one great experiment to create a new flavor" – and that is how your NFT work. </p>
                    
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">We are not humiliating any sweetmeat maker or an artist who inspires hundreds of Non-fungibles globally. It's just that we can match the dots to find the work's provenance. For instance, you can tell each distinct flavor's origin by looking at the creamy mushy ice cream colors. Now here's where the standing ovation comes in for the original inventor of the syrupy smelting gelato. The latter is a bit cold and easy to taste, but our topic's OG NFT is a hotcake for creative and well-heeled trendsetters.  </p>
                    
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Now let's discuss NFTs in real-time. These digital tokens in an art form look like traditional miniature canvases. But they are relatively more valuable and pristine if you look closely. These pixel oeuvres hold database and "real money" face value. Thanks to the Bitcoin trend and the cryptocurrency gold rush, these digital artworks are the next dominating multi-million virtual denomination. Also, it's under the radar of graphic designers, art collectors, celebrities, and other filthy rich bigwigs.</p>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">We know NFT by definition, but what is its technicality?</p>
                    
                    <!-- <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Amazon</h2> -->

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Non-fungibles are built on the same framework as cryptocurrency. These are works of art, painting, historical pieces, cultural spoofs, and memes. They are also known as cryptographic assets. However, you cannot exchange or trade these like the mainstream cryptocurrency. </p>
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">NFTs include unique data points and enjoy authentication privileges for profits. These go under strict scrutiny and verification of original makers before artists and capitalists can determine their price tag. And as their name goes, "non-fungible." In contrast, Bitcoin, Ethereum, and real money are fungible due to a lack of distinctive motives and properties. Hence, people can trade and exchange them with no strings attached. NFTs, on the contrary, have strings. The more it has, the better its asset is worth.</p>
                                        
                    <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Key Features of NFT Artwork</h2>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">The primary quality of an NFT is its origin data compactness. You can easily compress data in these valuable assets without plunging into HDDs and cloud servers. However, there are certain traits of Non-fungible tokens that make them a foolproof investment. These include:</p>
                
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4"><b>Transparency</b> – no person can easily retrieve them as NFTs require identification.</p>
                    
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4"><b>Tradability</b> – well-off art persons and collectors are eager to buy and invest </p>
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4"><b>Authenticity</b> – NFTs are impossible to imitate. Expect only good replicas if a programmer tries a James Bond 007 or an Ethan Hunt's Mission Impossible sequence.  </p>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4"><b>High Liquidity</b> – You can convert NFTs into real cash on the go without hurting the face value. </p>
                    
                    <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Have NFTs become run-of-the-mill? – Or they're still the millionaires' mint?</h2>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Well, dreaming big does not cost you money, and not us as well. Envisaging swapping a tasteful artwork for flavorsome ice cream is a pretty impressive child's utopian vision. Perhaps this article will unfold something considerable before you wish to exchange real money with mesmerizing "multi-million dollar" art piece. </p>
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Expect only amateur artists and naysayers can exclaim: "Yes, NFT is like Minecraft." In the game sense, we can agree on parallel pixel origin for both. But in reality, poor and middle-class people are far away even when they say 'NFT.' Only big brands, moguls, and people with fantastic "discerning" taste in art can enjoy these sounds – cha-ching! </p>
                    
                   
                    <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Best Marketable Grounds for NFTs</h2>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Buying or making an NFT is a common query these days, but what about its marketplace? Where you can sell or buy Non-Fungibles is a question many that settle the debate whether you should invest your money in NFTS or not. First off, eCommerce owners can feel free to buy these art data log files. Content creators can make good use of NFTs by enhancing their platforms by highlighting their NFT attainments. Thus, they can control the eCommerce economy by acting as content capitalists via their NFT proprietary rights.  </p>

                    
                    <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Ethereum Cryptocurrency is the universal NFT Coinage</h2>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Unlike bitcoin, which might require intricate processes and formalities to subdue an NFT owner, Ethereum works quite the opposite. This cryptocurrency version is an excellent virtual asset that helps you procure NFTs easily. Please read here about the best NFT platforms to invest your money. OpenSea, of course, is the mightiest of the lot if you're looking for the perfect shot! </p>
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">You can buy NFTs with this diamond-shaped currency easily. Truly, it has the face the gemstone's par value that even wins you discounts, rewards, and references. Since Ethereum products and assets share the same contextual origin, you can easily trade them with Non-fungible tokens. This currency also fortifies the previous owners' credentials with indissoluble encryption data. Thus, making it impossible for NFT scammers to create forgeries or imitate them differently.</p>
                    
                   
                    <h2 class="h3 primary uppercase mb-4">Conclusion</h2>

                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">In summary, NFTs are the perfect artwork of painters in a miniature digital form that doesn't lose value. All the captions above are accurate to their words and statements. Non-fungibles are the best trendsetter of the millennium amid their ubiquitous artistic roots. And we all know people of all ages, education, and background love everything imaginatively arty. </p>
                    <p class="primary text regular mb-4">Also, we would like to thank the beloved YouTube creators working readily to educate the masses. Here's a video from the platform to declare their dedication and meticulous approach to guiding you through the process. Remember, absorbing NFTs is an intense journey to behold. It will take time to absorb everything about these fascinating digital art blocks. We hope you loved reading our beginners' ultimate NFT blog and learned something new today. </p>
